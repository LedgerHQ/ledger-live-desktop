# ⛔️ DEPRECATED

This repository is now deprecated. We moved to a new mono repository architecture containing all of Ledger Live JavaScript Ecosystem that you can find [here](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-live). 
You can follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/wiki/Migrate-from-previous-repositories#migration) to help you make the transition.

> Ledger Live is a new generation wallet desktop application providing a unique interface to maintain multiple cryptocurrencies for your Ledger Nano S / Blue. Manage your device, create accounts, receive and send cryptoassets, [...and many more](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-launches-ledger-live-the-all-in-one-companion-app-to-your-ledger-device).

## Architecture

Ledger Live is an hybrid desktop application built with Electron, React, Redux, RxJS,.. and highly optimized with [ledger-core](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core) C++ library to deal with blockchains (sync, broadcast,..) via [ledger-core-node-bindings](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core-node-bindings). It communicates to Ledger hardware wallet devices (Nano X / Nano S / Blue) to verify address and sign transactions with [ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs). Some logic is shared with [live-common](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common).

## Download

The latest stable release is available on [ledger.com/ledger-live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/).

Previous versions and pre-releases can be downloaded on here from the [Releases](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-desktop/releases) section.

### Compatibility

- macOS 10.14+
- Windows 8.1+ (x64)
- Linux (x64)

## Signed hashes

Ledger Live releases are signed. The automatic update mechanism makes use of the signature to verify that each subsequent update is authentic. Instructions for verifying the hash and signatures of the installation packages are available [on this page](https://ledger-live-tools.now.sh/lld-signatures), which will be integrated into the [official download page](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download).

# Development

## Setup

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) `lts/fermium` (Node 14.x)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) (Classic)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7 or 3.5+
- A C/C++ toolchain (see [node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix))
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev`

## Install

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn
```

## Run

```bash
# launch the app
yarn start
```

## Build

```bash
# Build & package the whole app
# Creates a .dmg for Mac, .exe installer for Windows, or .AppImage for Linux
# Output files will be created in dist/ folder
yarn dist
```

## Debug

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE, here is a [Launch Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration) that should allow you to run and debug the main process as well as the render process of the application.

As stated in the [debugging documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging), this file should be named `launch.json` and located under the `.vscode` folder.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "compounds": [
    {
      "name": "Run and Debug LLD",
      "configurations": ["Debug Main Process", "Debug Renderer Process"],
      "stopAll": true
    }
  ],
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Main Process",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "runtimeExecutable": "yarn",
      "args": ["start"],
      "outputCapture": "std",
      "resolveSourceMapLocations": null,
      "env": {
        "ELECTRON_ARGS": "--remote-debugging-port=8315"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Debug Renderer Process",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "attach",
      "address": "localhost",
      "port": 8315,
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Config (optional helpers)

### Environment variables

(you can use a .env or export environment variables)

```bash
NO_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1
NO_DEBUG_DB=1
NO_DEBUG_ACTION=1
NO_DEBUG_TAB_KEY=1
NO_DEBUG_NETWORK=1
NO_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1
NO_DEBUG_WS=1
NO_DEBUG_DEVICE=1
NO_DEBUG_COUNTERVALUES=1
```

other envs can be seen in [live-common:src/env.js](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/env.js)

### Run tests

In a terminal you need to have webpack dev server running

```bash
yarn start
```

In an other terminal you need to launch the webdriver/electron container. First run will be slow.
Next ones will be fast unless some changes are made to the container or package.json. You need to kill and re run the command if package.json changed. Make sure you are running Docker.

```bash
yarn start-electron-webdriver
```

You can point VNCViewer to `localhost::5900` to check what is happening in the container. `secret` is the password.
Then you can launch tests.

```bash
yarn spectron
```

or

```bash
node_modules/.bin/jest tests/specs/<FILEREGEX>.spec.js
```

By default it uses --runInBand jest option otherwise it explodes!

If you need to create an app.json, run a test that set up what you need and run it with the env var `SPECTRON_DUMP_APP_JSON` set. It will create `tests/dump.json` at the end of the spec.

**Please put the image expectations at the end of the it(...) tests so that it does not break the whole flow if a snapshot breaks**

### Run code quality checks

```bash
yarn ci
```

## Localization / Translations
Translations from English to other languages are handled internally so it is not possible to directly contribute to them, however if you spot a bug (e.g. a wrong variable name) or any issue in translation files, feel free to report a bug to Ledger's support team and it will be taken care of.
