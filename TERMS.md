## Eligibility

To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old or qualify as an adult in your country of residence. If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.

You can only use the Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.

## Ledger Services

Ledger Live, in connection with Ledger Devices, provides you with a convenient and secure way to manage your Device Applications as well as use Private Keys derived from your 24-word Recovery Phrase.

The Ledger Services allow Users to:

- Update the firmware of their Ledger Device
- Install and uninstall Device Applications with the Ledger Live Manager
- View their portfolio of Crypto Assets
- Access the means to perform operations on various blockchain networks in accordance with their respective protocol rules, such as but not limited to:
  - Send and receive Crypto Assets to and from Users of a dedicated blockchain network;
- Connect with Third Party Services, to access services such as the delegation of staking rights on supported proof-of-stake blockchains or buying crypto.

Ledger operates non-custodial services, which means that we do not store, nor do we have access to your Crypto Assets nor your Private Keys. We do not send or receive Crypto Assets. Any Crypto Asset transfer occurs on blockchain networks and not on a network owned or controlled by Ledger.

Ledger Live and Ledger Devices are only capable of supporting certain Crypto Assets. A non-exhaustive list of supported Crypto Assets and compatible Wallets is available [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005304449-Supported-crypto-assets#targetText=Ledger%20Live%20supports%2022%20crypto,as%20send%20and%20receive%20them.). This list is subject to variation.

## Risk

You are deemed to be fully aware of all the legal norms and technical constraints relating to the proof-of-stake and proof-of-work blockchains, and to the Services.You acknowledge that you have been warned of the following associated risks:

**Regulatory changes.** Blockchain technologies are subject to continuous regulatory changes and scrutiny around the world, including but not limited to anti-money laundering and financial regulations. You acknowledge that certain Services, including their availability, could be impacted by one or more regulatory requirements.

**Tax.** Transactions in Crypto Assets, or more generally Crypto Assets events, including but not limited to exchanges, air-drops, forks, and gains arising from staking, may be considered tax events according to the legislations under which you are subject to taxation. These rules may be unclear or subject to change, and you are therefore encouraged to consult your own tax or accounting adviser before doing Crypto Assets events.

**Technology**. Users understand that some of the technology supported or made available through the Services are new, untested and outside of Ledger's control. Advances in cryptography, or other technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to blockchain networks which could result in the theft or loss of Crypto Assets. Other adverse changes in market forces or in the technology, broadly construed, may prevent or compromise Ledger's performance under these Terms.

**Cybersecurity**. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Ledger's products and information systems in several ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, side-channel attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.

There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in these Terms. Before you use our Services, you are strongly encouraged to carefully assess whether your financial situation and risk tolerance is compatible with such use.

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the generality of the Limitation of Liability section, you hereby agree that Ledger shall have no liability for any loss that incurs as a consequence of the risks highlighted in this section.

## No retrieval of Private Keys

**The only existing backup is with you.** Ledger does not have access to or store passwords, 24-word Recovery Phrase, Private Keys, passphrases, transaction history, PIN, or other credentials associated with your use of the Services. We are not in a position to help you retrieve your credentials. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing, and keeping your credentials in a secure location, away from prying eyes. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your 24-word Recovery Phrase or PIN can gain control of the Private Keys associated with your Ledger Device or of the 24-word Recovery Phrase;

**Keep your credentials safe.** When you set your Ledger Device up, you must: (a) create and remember a strong PIN that you do not use for any other service; (b) protect and keep your 24-word Recovery Phrase secure and confidential; (c) protect access to your Ledger Device;

## Acceptable Use

As a user of the Ledger Services, we grant you a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Ledger Services. When using Ledger Services, we ask that you follow some basic rules:

**Do no harm.** You agree (i) not to distribute any virus or other harmful computer code through Ledger's systems, (ii) not to use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper or other automated means or interface not provided by us to access Ledger Services or to extract data, (iii) not to provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information, and (iv) not to take any action that may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our or any of our third party providers' infrastructure.

**Don't circumvent our security**. You agree not to bypass, circumvent, or attempt to bypass or circumvent any measures that we may use to prevent or restrict access to Ledger Services including, without limitation, Ledger Devices connected to Ledger Services, other accounts, information systems, or networks.

**Don't break the law**. You agree that you will not violate any laws when using Ledger Services. This includes any local, provincial, state, federal, national, or international laws that may apply to you. You agree that you will not use Ledger Services to pay for, support, or otherwise engage in any illegal activities including, but not limited to, fraud, illegal gambling, money laundering, or terrorist activities. You further agree not to encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the activities prohibited under this section.

**Don't interfere**. You agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user's Wallet without authorization, or use Ledger Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other Users from fully enjoying Ledger Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of Ledger Services in any manner.

Any use of Ledger Services other than as specifically authorized in these Terms, without our prior written permission, is strictly prohibited and will terminate your license to use Ledger Services.

## Warranties and Disclaimers

Ledger will use reasonable level of skill and care to ensure that Ledger Services can be accessed by you in accordance with the present Terms of Use, but there are no guarantees that access and features will not be interrupted or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions, corruption or loss of transmitted information. Ledger Services are provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, and in particular without implied warranties of merchantability, reliability, and fitness for a particular purpose.

### Availability of Ledger Services

We may change, update or suspend the Services, temporarily or indefinitely, so as to carry out works including, but not limited to: firmware and software updates, maintenance operations, amendments to the servers, bug fixes etc. We will make reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of any significant disruption of Ledger Services.

Ledger does not guarantee the correct functioning of the Services in the event of the installation or use of programs or applications that do not conform to Service specifications and technical standards.

Please note that when a Ledger Service is unavailable or suspended, you can always recover your Private Keys using your 24-Recovery Phrase on any compatible Wallet.

### Underlying blockchain protocols

All transactions created through Ledger Services are confirmed and recorded in associated blockchain networks. Such networks are decentralized peer-to-peer networks run by independent third parties, which Ledger does not own, control or operate. We have no control over blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that the transactions you broadcast on Ledger Services will be confirmed and processed. You acknowledge that we do not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets and you agree that the transactions you configure on Ledger Services may fail, or may be substantially delayed by the underlying blockchain networks.

On occasions, the blockchain protocol of a given Crypto Asset may change, which may have consequences on its key characteristics including but not limited to their availability, name, security, valuation or the way it operates. Forks entail that forked Crypto Assets may be misdirected or replicated. In any such events, Ledger may decide, at its discretion, to suspend support of the impacted Crypto Asset for as long as Ledger deems necessary. When it so decides, Ledger will endeavor to give you advance notice, but may not be able to. You should keep yourself apprised of such events and make all necessary arrangements.

### Device Applications

Device Applications are available for download on Ledger Live Manager, or can be installed following our [guidelines](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userspace/getting_started.html) and may either be developed by Ledger, or by any willing third party, thanks to open source code available on Ledger [Github repository.](https://github.com/LedgerHQ)

Developers of Device Applications are responsible for the said applications and their performance, and for providing support for Device Applications supported on a Ledger Device and on Ledger Live. Ledger may perform code reviews and conduct security audits of Device Applications available on Ledger Live Manager, which does not constitute any kind of endorsement nor any guarantee that those applications are risk-free.

Ledger does not warranty that Device Applications will be maintained over time and reserves the right to restrict or suspend access to them from Ledger Services for any reason for as long as deemed necessary.

### Experimental features

In order to accommodate advanced Users' requests and to build new features and functionalities, we have released a series of experimental features on Ledger Live. These features may not be complete and have not been fully tested, which may present heightened risks. They may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information. You can think of these features as beta features. Ledger does not guarantee the stability, functionality, or long-term support of these features. We do not recommend to use these features unless you are an advanced User with strong technical skills. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of the Experimental Features is at your sole risk.

## Transaction details

**Do not trust. Verify.** Software integrity, especially when connected to the Internet, is very hard to verify. Ledger's security model relies on trusted display. This is why the verification of the information on your Ledger Device is paramount. Before you approve an operation, you must always double check that the information displayed on your mobile or desktop screen is correct and matches the information displayed on your Ledger Device. Upon sending Crypto Assets, you are solely responsible for verifying that the recipient address, amount and fees are correct and that they are the same on both your computer or mobile and on your Ledger Device's screen. You also acknowledge that using unverified addresses to receive Crypto Assets comes at your own risk.

## Third Party Services and Materials

Ledger Live may incorporate, reference or provide access to Third Party Services.

You agree that your use of Third Party Services is subject to separate terms and conditions between you and the third party identified in Ledger Live. Ledger is not responsible for any performance, or failure to perform the Third Party Services. It is your responsibility to review the third party's terms and policies before using a Third Party Service. Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your personal data. The processing of such data will be handled in accordance with the relevant Third Party's privacy policy and best practices.

Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your software or Ledger Device, and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by Third Party Services. If you have questions or concerns about how a Third Party Service operates, or need support, please contact the relevant third party directly.

We advise not to share any credential, password, Private Key, passphrase, or any other sensitive information with any Third Party Service without validating their legitimacy first.

We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any such Third Party Service for any reason and without prior notice.

Specific rules and obligations apply to the following Services:
